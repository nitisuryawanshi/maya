We believe that it is important for open source communities to be pleasant place for all its contributors and participants. As active followers and contributors of the Open Source community, the OpenEBS team wants to establish a code of conduct for all its members to ensure a healthy and constructive community behaviour.
 
#1 OpenEBS aspires and promises to be a diverse community and is committed in ensuring a friendly, courteous, healthy and safe environment to everyone who contributes or wishes to contribute to the project in any possible way. We request you to help us in maintaining this environment within the community.
 
#2 We expect all the communication within the community on any platform - direct, Github, Slack, Twitter, Facebook, mail, etc. - to be devoid of personal attacks, humiliation, harassment, demeaning speech, discrimination and every other unprofessional act.
 
#3 We expect all our contributors from all platforms to follow and maintain the code of conduct and the failure to do so would result in immediate action against the member. These actions may include a permanent ban from the community, removal of issues, comment and PR, blocking of accounts as deemed appropriate by the team.
 
#4 If you do or have come across any unacceptable behaviour or have any other issues, please contact our team at openebs@cloudbyte.com
